# This is the titlekeys_overwrite.txt file, you may overwrite existing titlekeys in the titlekeys.txt file. 
# This is useful for DLCs with different titlekeys as the version increases! You put "#" (hash tag) at the beginning of the line to comment.
# You can use either titleID or rightsID for the first line before the "|" split, 
# please make sure that: titleID is 16 characters, and titlekey and rightsID (if you decide to use it) is 32 characters long
# If you know more titlekeys please add to the list yourself, and it will be nice if you could share it with the community too!
