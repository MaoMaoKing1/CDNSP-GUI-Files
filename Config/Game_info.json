Some Chambers have multiple goals, and depending on which \ngoals you reach, the game diverges into seven different routes. There \nalso exists a secret route that can only be unlocked under certain \nconditions. To clear each route you must reach the colored goal that \nappears at the end. The seven basic routes and one secret route equal a \ntotal of fifty Chambers all together for you to challenge.\n\nThe game also features original music composed by sanodg to accompany \nyou as you play throughout the game.\n\nHD rumble will also allow you to feel which direction the box extends in.",

Overcome obstacles, figure out how to collect all \nthe coins, find all the gems and remember your childhood while doing it! \nProgress through the game's dungeon through non-linear exploration and \nkeep an open eye for secrets to find.\n\nFeatures:\n\nA dungeon of 50+ rooms to overcome, each its own mini-level\n\nOpen exploration, choose which way to go, but don't worry, a helpful \nmap is just one button press away\n\nChallenging, old-school platforming\n\nCollect as many coins as you want, but we both know you want them all\n\nCoins will make you rich, but there's no escaping the dungeon without \nall the gems\n\nSecret scrolls to find for the more observant player\n\nBest of all, play the game on a selection of 7 virtual old machines, \nfrom the Pomo D'or 4, to Maple and Some Toy and all the way to the \nNS-Bos PC\n\nHeads up!The Adventures of Elena Temple is just one game you can \nplay on seven simulated machines. Aside from the different look, the \ngame plays the same on all machines and has the exact same content! The \npurpose of these old machines is to remind you of the old days, so feel \nfree to pick whichever you like best without any fear of missing out on \ngame content.\n\nI'm a solo indie developer, I loved making The Adventures of Elena \nTemple and I hope you enjoy it!

The new Burst Combo system rewards you for finishing \noff enemies and bosses up close and personal, and the Dowsing ability \ntriggers the HD Rumble function when you get close to one of the many \nhidden items/areas in the game.\n\nThe classic pixel style graphics have also been completely redone to \nblur the line between 8-bit and 16-bit and take you back to the golden \nage of 2D action games!",

Bayonetta is the \nfashionable and foxy unholy offspring of an Umbra Witch and a Lumen \nSage, and she's lost her memory after being asleep at the bottom of a \nlake for 500 years.\n\nUse Wicked Weaves to summon Infernal Demons, dodge enemies' dangerous \nattacks to slow down time, and punish angels with deadly devices. You \ncan even dress Bayonetta up in four Nintendo-themed costumes\u2014Princess \nPeach, Princess Daisy, Link, and Samus Aran.",

Spending a couple of weeks at Mount Massive, during which he \nwas unable to even talk to his wife and son thanks to strict security \nprotocols, Waylon developed a deep-seated distrust of the \nprofit-motivated scientists and doctors leading dangerous and \nirresponsible experiments on their patients. Identifying with those poor \nsouls fueled Waylon's anger, and set the stage for his unmasking of \nMount Massive's rotten core. Although Whistleblower tells the story that \nled to Outlast, it will actually stretch past the events of the first \ngame to show the final chapter in Mount Massive Asylum's story.\n\nOutlast and the Outlast: Whistleblower DLC is a true survival horror \nexperience which aims to show that the most terrifying monsters of all \ncome from the human mind.\n\nFeatures:\n\nTrue Survival Horror Experience: You are no fighter - if you want to \nsurvive the horrors of the asylum, your only chance is to run... or \nhide\n\nImmersive Graphics: AAA-quality graphics give players a detailed, \nterrifying world to explore\n\nHide and Sneak: Stealth-based gameplay, with parkour-inspired \nplatforming elements\n\nUnpredictable Enemies: Players cannot know when - and from where - one \nof the asylum's terrifying inhabitants will finally catch up to them\n\nReal Horror: Outlast's setting and characters are inspired by real \nasylums and cases of criminal insanity",

The basic principle is as \neasy as applying it is complex: Exit the chambers via the exit doors. \nBut be weary of the WorkerDroids in charge of maintaining the chambers. \nThey\u2019re not exactly what you and I would call \"human friendly.\"\n\nUse the ChromaGun to colorize walls and WorkerDroids to progress in the \nchambers. WorkerDroids are attracted to walls of the same color. Using \nthat mechanic, try to reach the exit door of each chamber. Some doors \nare more complicated to use than others: They can only be opened using \ndoor triggers and only stay open as long as the triggers are occupied.\n\nIf all of this sounds like your brain can handle it, congratulations! \nYou're the perfect candidate for our test chambers!\n\nThat being said, welcome and good luck!",

In secret, they fill the roly-poly world with \nlight and life. But when their existence is discovered, they become \nhunted.

Everything changes, when they meet the mysterious Mama \nDola, who seems to know more about Robert's destiny than Robert would \nlike.",

It's a game that asks, what if you could \ndeform and reshape the world itself? Semblance takes the idea of a \n'platform' in a platformer and turns it on it\u2019s head. What if platforms \nwere actually part of the gameplay, part of the way you solved problems?\n\nExplore a world where the default is soft, where the property of \n'hardness' doesn't exist. Each of the game's three worlds explore a new \nconsequence of a planet that can shift, change and deform. Beat back the \nstrange, crystalline infection of hard material by freeing the world's \nlife essences and uncover the dark cause for its appearance.\n\nUnique and innovative deforming platform gameplay:Can't reach a \ncollectible? Just deform and elevate a piece of the ground so that the \npoint you jump from is higher. Nasty spikes in the way? Just deform and \npush-down the ground lower so that you can pass by. Squish, bounce, \nsquash and transform the world- and yourself to solve problems.\n\nBeautiful Minimalist Aesthetic Design:Explore 3 worlds bursting with \ncolorful minimalist charm, quirky critters, and calming vistas. Become \nhypnotized by each world's dynamically layered score, each with a hint \nof African aural distinction.\n\nExplore non-linearly:The game allows you to move between puzzles as \nyou wish, never forcing you to find a solution in order to progress and \nenabling you to come back later. Similarly, the game's narrative is \npresented expansively, allowing you to explore- and piece together the \nstory for yourself as you roam the game.",

        "description": "Super Daryl Deluxe is an RPGvania with brawler-style combat set inside \nof a perfectly normal, sprawling, multi-dimensional high school. Like \nany other perfectly normal school, its students and faculty are going \nmissing and the classrooms have been locked down for weeks. Yes, there's \nnothing remarkable happening at WFHS whatsoever - just ask the new \nprincipal.\n\nThings are bound to get stirred up when an enthusiastic, bizarrely \ndressed new kid wanders into town. This go-getter's name is Daryl, and \nhe just wants to make friends. What starts out as an innocent effort to \nhelp jump-start a young contraband textbook business turns into a \nharrowing quest through the school and its enormous, monster-filled \nclassrooms in the hope of becoming the most popular kid in town. Oh - \nand saving everyone's lives is top priority, of course.\n\nNo need to worry. There's nothing to see here at Water Falls High School.",

Of course, the space station will \ndefend itself, which is where the fun begins: the station's defences, \nwith their never-ending arsenal of weapons and artifacts, will have to \nbe destroyed. But the story gets more complicated when the hackers find \nout about their agent's hidden ties...\n\nWEAPONS: Weapons reload on the go and they never run out of bullets. No \nneed to hoard ammo for the boss battle! The various weapons can be found \nor purchased (depending on the game mode) and each one has its strengths \nand weaknesses.\n\nGHOST: The protagonist is not the android you see, but the being that \nremotely controls it: a mysterious digital ghost that can leave its \nrobot chassis, pass through doors and walls, control enemy androids, and \nuse their own tools against them. What happens if the robot you control \ngets destroyed, you ask? Then your ghost will be free to control \nsomething else, or return to your main body.\n\nUPGRADES: You can have as many as you can collect. The upgrades are \npassive, so they work without needing any special controls, and they \ndon't run out or deactivate. They come in a large assortment, from \naggressive drones to bullet improvements. Remember that the more you \nget, the more OP you are.\n\nITEMS: Devices you can use at any time. High-tech equivalents to potions \nand scrolls.\n\nGEEKIES: Spread throughout the game are hidden \"geekies\". If you find \none and activate it, something related to that geekie will change in the \ngame (not affecting gameplay)... and the challenge is to find out what \nchanges. I know, it sounds silly, but some of them are funny.\n\nSECRETS: 200 rooms have secrets in them that can be revealed by \nperforming a specific action. If you find a secret, you're rewarded with \na small permanent powerup that will make your character more powerful. \nIn addition, finding all of the secrets in each level will reward you \nwith something very special.\n\nMAP: The whole map has around 300 rooms, divided into zones. Each zone \nhas its own enemies, its own ambience, its own soundtrack, and, of \ncourse, its own boss.\n\nSTORY: The story is not to save the world, but rather to go on an \nintruiging journey wrought with humor. Not to mention all the dialogues \nand cinematics, all voiced in English.\n\nGAME MODES: Ghost has 2 game modes: \"classic\" and \"survival\". Classic is \nsimilar to a metroidvania, where the more you advance through the game, \nthe more stuff you obtain and the harder the enemies become. Survival is \ncrazier, as you get stuff much faster and you'll soon turn into a \nkilling machine, but you lose everything when you die.\n\nSKILL TREE: The RPG component of the game is found in the skill tree, \nwhere you can spend skill points to level up characters, obtaining \nspecial skills for each one. Depending on what skills you select, your \ngameplay will change in an interesting way.\n\nAnd the rest is a mystery, one that I shouldn't spoil... you'll just \nhave to discover the rest on your own.",

        "description": "The new TorqueL -Physics Modified Edition- has been released with \nupdated physics following an update to the game engine, while still \nproviding the same experience as the original TorqueL game.\n\nTorqueL is a curiously unique 2D rotation action game, in which you \nproceed by rotating or extending a box with characters inside.\n\nSometimes simply rotating or extending the box is not enough, and you \nhave to find the right combination of rotating and extending to jump or \nclimb over obstacles.\n\nPlayers progress through the game by guiding the box towards the goal in \neach Chamber. Some Chambers have multiple goals, and depending on which \ngoals you reach, the game diverges into seven different routes. There \nalso exists a secret route that can only be unlocked under certain \nconditions. To clear each route you must reach the colored goal that \nappears at the end. The seven basic routes and one secret route equal a \ntotal of fifty Chambers all together for you to challenge.\n\nThe game also features original music composed by sanodg to accompany \nyou as you play throughout the game.\n\nHD rumble will also allow you to feel which direction the box extends in.",

        "description": "Brawlout packs a punch with couch and online play modes, blending \nplatform fighter mechanics and traditional fighting game play into a \nstylish and fluid battle royale.\n\nRather than slow-paced defensive battles, Brawlout goes all-out with the \nlightning-fast aerobatics which platform fighters are famous for.\n\nStriking the balance between the growing competitive scene and the \ngenre\u2019s party game roots, Brawlout hopes to cater to the veteran \nplatform fighter, the casual fan and the newcomer looking to make their \nmark.\n\nEach character in Brawlout has their own unique playstyle, catering to \nspecific character archetypes seen in other fighters. Whether you\u2019re a \ndie-hard grappler or a rushdown fiend, there is a fighter for you in \nBrawlout.\n\nThere are currently six original characters and two popular indie \ncharacters to choose from that allow for varied play styles. As well as \ncosmetic skins, each original Brawlout character has three Variants; alt \nversions of the character with different stats, outfits and even new \nmoves. With these Variants, Brawlout\u2019s cast numbers 18 individual \nfighters. Find the fighter and Variant that\u2019s right for you and tear it \nup on the battlefield.\n\nCombined with familiar movement techniques like wavedashing and \nairdodging, Brawlout adds some extra mechanics seen in other fighting \ngames. The Rage Meter builds up as you both deal and take damage, \nallowing you either break combos with the Rage Burst or unleash hell \nwith the Rage Mode. The Rage Burst pushes opponents back, breaking their \ncombos and allowing players to create some breathing room at the cost of \nhalf their Rage Meter. If the meter fills, you can activate the Rage \nMode, increasing the knockback you deal while reducing the amount you \ntake.\n\nAs for modes, Brawlout has all you\u2019d expect from a normal platform \nfighter and then some. Up to four players can compete in either timed, \nstock or team battles:\n\nAll on the same device\n\nEach with their own device, without any internet connection, playing \nnearby\n\nOnline either with friends or other Brawlout players\n\nAI opponents are also available if you want to practice your team \ncombos with a friend, or if you need to fill out a free for all. Train \nwith Advanced Tutorials or go in for yourself in challenging Arcade \nTowers.",

And when the frog runs out of \nlife, he \"enters the hospital\" and has to restart from the beginning of \nthe stage. But you can keep collecting and saving up money to go \n\"shopping\" to increase your life and carefully select powered-up weapons \nto take down enemies you couldn't defeat before. The further you get, \nthe stronger you can feel yourself becoming - and it feels good.\n\nThe characters appearing in between stages are the game's other charm \npoint. You'll meet your coworker, who is a cat (for some reason), your \npresident (also a cat), and an office lady of indeterminate species. \nThey work like us, slog through overtime like us, complain, get chewed \nout, and even comfort each other, just like us.\n\nExperience the unique and intricately detailed world of Kero Blaster!",

When the hero's family becomes affected by the \ndisease, he starts a dangerous journey to find the mythical sorceress, \nLady Death, who is supposed to have powers that can stop or perhaps even \nreverse the disease.\n\nThe hero travels through many levels and include a forest, a cemetery, a \nbattlefield, a ghost town, etc. Nearly all levels have their own \nalternative reality versions; slightly different versions that hold a \nfew more objects or traps in different locations. As the story develops, \nthe player uncovers more about the main hero\u2019s past, his motivation and \nsome very dark secrets.\n\nA mistake, a wrong jump or simply not being careful enough means instant \ndeath. Precision jumps and quick running are not enough, however. Some \ntraps need to be deactivated and some objects, like stones or crates, \nneed to be moved into certain positions. Sometimes there\u2019s no object to \nmove or trigger unless the hero uses one of his special powers, which \nare rare in the game. The hero may jump into an alternative reality. \nSome traps can be avoided only if time moves slower than usual, thanks \nto yet another special ability. In some cases the hero can even create a \nclone of himself!\n\nBy using all of your abilities and finding your way through the \ndifferent realities you may yet find lady death.",

        "description": "Fun and Quirky shoot-em-up game.\n\nThe object of the game is to shoot the chickens using an array of different weaponry, from pistols, to AK47, RPG\u2019s to Alien Ray Guns! Gameplay is set over a field twice as wide as the screen, so you must be constantly moving your aim side to side in order to reach the whole game field.\n\nTo increase the difficulty, the chickens throw eggs at the screen to obscure the player\u2019s field of view. Once your screen is covered\u2026 GAME OVER!\n\nDuring each level, ammo crates drop at varying intervals which will refresh your ammo levels and \u201cShino\u201d.\n\nCarry up to 3 weapons with you only 4 are available in the earlier levels, the remaining weapons will unlock as you progress through the levels.\n\nThe game contains 15 different levels. Each level introduces different baddie chickens with varying difficulties to kill them due to enhanced protection gear. Chicken types include Riot Police Chickens, Tank Chickens, Ninja Chickens, Helicopter Chickens and many more!",

If \nyou manage to beat my ghostly henchmen and get through the rooms, you'll \nreceive lots of hidden rewards\u2026but can you do it? I guess I'll wait and \nsee! Heh heh heh\u2026\"\n\nThe game is composed of a series of stages and there are ghosts and \nlocked doors within each stage. Greco and his ghosts will present the \nplayer with problems that they will need to solve in order to defeat \nthe ghosts, unlock the doors, and proceed to the next stage.\n\nThe player can face off against and defeat ghosts. Doing so will earn \nthe player treasures(items) and ghost coins which can be used to \nreveal hints and unlock special bonus stages.\n\nYour child can happily play while studying math and develop stronger \nskills regarding division after some time.\n\nLearning System (Game Contents)\n\n[Select Problem]-----Players answer the questions by choosing the \ncorrect answer of the question from a series of numbers shown using \ncards.\n\nChoosing the correct number will cause the ghost to take damage, \nreducing its HP(health points) by a set amount and earning the player \nsome ghost coins.\n\nIf the player reduces the ghosts HP to 0, the ghost will be defeated, \nand the player will receive items and ghost coins.\n\nBy selecting and pushing [Hint] the player will be able to see a hint \nthat can aid them in solving the question. Choosing to reveal a hint \nwill require the player to spend ghost coins.\n\n[Unlock ]-----Remove the lock hung on the door by using the correct \nanswer to the problem.\n\nIf certain conditions are met and the numbers on the lock match with \nthe numbers of problems solved correctly, then the lock will be \nremoved.\n\nIf all the locks on a door are removed then the door will open, and \nthe player can advance further through the game.\n\nBy selecting and pushing [Hint] the player will be able to see a hint \nthat can aid them in solving the question. Choosing to reveal a hint \nwill require the player to spend ghost coins.\n\n[Bonus Stage]-----By acquiring the required item or \"key,\" the player \ncan advance to a special bonus stage.\n\nIn this game mode, players must defeat as many ghosts as possible \nwithin the time limit.\n\nWhen the player exterminates ghosts, they will receive ghost coins.\n\nSo, let's aim for the final stage where the decisive battle with Greco \nawaits! A game that lets your child enjoy learning and studying math is \ncoming to the Nintendo Switch. Greco and his ghosts are waiting for the \nnext challenger!\n\nWith Nintendo Parental Controls, you can utilize your smart phone to \nmonitor your child's activities. For example, the feature can be used in \nsuch a way that for every hour your child spends playing a game, you can \nencourage them to play a study game, such as Greco's Calculation Castle, \nfor 30 minutes. So, how about deciding the rules with your child?",

        "description": "Hours after receiving an urgent call in his Parris apartment, the \nprotagonist of D/Generation, a nameless courier, arrives in London via \nhis Jet-Pack, touching down on the 80th floor of Genoq Biolabs' medical \nresearch facility with an important package for lead Genoq scientist \nJean-Paul Derrida. As soon as he enters, however, the doors shut and \nseal themselves behind him. This, however, proves to be the least of his \nproblems, as the receptionist soon informs him of Genoq's dire state. \nAll lines of communication to the outside world have been severed, and \nfurthermore the building's security systems and dangerous Neogens have \nrun amok. Despite the perils within and the receptionist's adamant \nwarnings, the courier chooses to proceed, perhaps believing that the \nitem in his possession holds the key to stopping the chaos which grips \nGenoq.\n\nOver the course of his journey into the building's upper reaches, the \ncourier learns that Genoq had been steeped in the realm of illegal \nbioweapon development for some time, and that their medical research, \nwhich had long ago become unprofitable for them, was little more than a \nfront for their more lucrative practice of creating and selling \nbiological weapons called Neogens. Derrida had been brought on by the \ncompany to spearhead a project which would create the ultimate Neogen, \nand the fruit of his efforts, an artificial organism dubbed \nD/Generation, was ultimately the source of the disturbances within the \nbuilding. Further complicating matters, he also learns that Genoq's \ncorporate leaders have authorized an airstrike against the building in \norder to prevent details of their activities from going public.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe main gameplay of D/Generation consists of traversing interconnected \nrooms (called \"scenes\" within the game), accomplishing various tasks \nwithin them in order to ascend to the next level of the tower. Each \nlevel is comprised of multiple scenes, and each scene typically presents \na particular challenge which must be overcome in order to progress. The \ngame alternates between action-based and puzzle-based gameplay, with \nmany scenes requiring some combination of both. On the action side of \nthings, players are constantly harassed by hostile Neogens and security \nsystems, which frequently require quick reflexes in order to defeat. \nCertain doors will only unlock when an area has been cleared of \ndangerous entities, and furthermore it is usually not feasible to rescue \nsurvivors (who grant additional lives) until an area has been completely \ncleared of enemies.\n\nAs the game reaches its climax, the tone becomes unexpectedly surreal.\n\nAt the same time, there are cases where it is more advantageous to \nmanipulate an enemy rather than killing it outright, which leads into \nthe game's more cerebral leanings. Trackers can be used to kill other \nTrackers without firing a shot, for instance, and a Neogen that collides \nwith a plasma barrier will permanently disable it. These are just two \nexamples of instances in which the player is rewarded for thinking \nbefore they shoot. Most areas contain switches which can open and close \ndoors, activate and deactivate security measures, or both, and success \nin many scenes comes down to manipulating these switches (as well as \nother devices, such as computer terminals and teleporters) in such a way \nas to provide safe passage for ones' self and any civilians. Timing and \npattern recognition is also a crucial element throughout the game, since \ntougher puzzles can require that a series of deliberate actions be \nperformed quickly.",

We fear that the workers trapped in our Singapore lab have little \nchance of survival. Those of you familiar with the Neogen organisms \nproduced in this lab would agree that any rescue attempt would be a \nsuicide mission. The remaining survivors are beyond hope.\n\nPrior to the outbreak, our recon satellites spotted an explosion near \nthe top of the building. This is where Derrida, our head scientist, is \ncreating the next Neogen prototype, the D/Generation.\n\nThe D/Generation represents an extremely advanced stage of artificial \nevolution. Equipped with sophisticated neuro-holographic camouflaging, \nit can disguise itself as anything. It also has a super-hardened dermal \nlayer that acts like a sheet of armour, malting it virtually \nindestructible.\n\nWe are now forced to accept the unthinkable, that the D/Generation is \nloose in the building. But this might only be the beginning. If it were \nto escape from the labs out into the real world, the D/Generation would \nthreaten every person on this planet...\n\nYour Objective\n\nAlone with your jetpack, you have flown from Finland across the Urals \nand the entire length of Asia to deliver a package to Genoq Biolabs in \nSingapore. You land on the buildings 80th floor setback, finding nobody \nthere to greet you. When you enter the building, the main door snaps \nshut behind you, and you narrowly escape being killed by the building's \nsecurity system.\n\nYou find the receptionist hiding behind her desk; she tells you that \nGenoq's head scientist Derrida, has been demanding the package you're \ncarrying. His last panicked message came over an hour ago. This package \nis more important than you could have thought!\n\nYou realise that there is only one course of action, that you must take \nthe package to Derrida, and if at all possible, rescue any survivors you \nfind along the way.",

If the player can time its use correctly; \nthey can use it just before a curve to shoot up a wall or JOLT through \nan obstacle. Many short cuts in the levels are JOLT dependent.\n\nOnce eliminated, a player has the opportunity to execute the VOID. After \npunching in the correct sequence, the VOID player is gifted a random \nPower-Up to inflict mass-disruption to the existing racers.\n\nThe game features multiple Game Modes; Racer is the standard and most \ngame modes are based off this, such as Light Mode (where the level is \ndark and the leading player has a light attached to them).",
